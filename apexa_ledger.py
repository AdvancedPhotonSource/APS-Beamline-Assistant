"""Execution ledger — APEXA's execution-integrity primitive.

What this replaces
------------------
APEXA's integrity property is: *never surface a result that is not backed by an
executed tool call.* Until now that property was approximated by a cluster of
regex heuristics over the model's prose (``_looks_like_hallucinated_result``,
``_check_count_hallucination``, ``_PHANTOM_ASYNC_RE``, ``_REFUSAL_RE``, the
strategy gate, the thrash floor, …). Those grew because the text ``TOOL_CALL:``
protocol let models *narrate* tool use instead of performing it.

They had a structural flaw: **they fired on prose patterns regardless of what had
actually executed.** So a legitimate multi-step investigation could trip them —
observed live, when the thrash floor cut off an FF-HEDM debugging session with
``⚠ thrash floor: 5× run_command — forcing answer``.

This module inverts that. Every check here has an **exact precondition drawn from
recorded execution state**, never from prose alone:

===========================  ====================================================
check                        exact precondition
===========================  ====================================================
``unexecuted_tool_calls``    model emitted N calls, fewer than N reached the
                             execution chokepoint (no silent drops)
``zero_execution_claim``     the ledger for this turn is EMPTY
``ungrounded_paths``         a path in the answer appears in NO tool output and
                             in NO user message (set difference over real data)
===========================  ====================================================

Because the precondition is a fact rather than a pattern, a turn that genuinely
ran tools cannot be interrupted by these checks — which is the specific
regression the old guards caused.

Pure Python, no MCP spin-up, no network: unit-testable in isolation (same pattern
as ``skill_registry.py`` and ``handbook_guardrails.py``).
