# Running APEXA as an always-on service

Goal: one persistent APEXA **web service** on a beamline machine (e.g. chiltepin /
chutoro), reachable in a browser on the APS network — so users don't launch it
per session. This is a deployment decision, not new code: `web_server.py` already
binds `0.0.0.0:8001`, ships a prebuilt frontend (no Node needed), and spawns the
`core` / `midas` / `motor` MCP servers itself.

---

## Recommendation

**Run it as a systemd *user* service.** Rationale:

- **No root required** — beamline accounts rarely have sudo. A user unit lives in
  `~/.config/systemd/user/` and is managed entirely by the owning account.
- **Survives logout and reboot** once linger is enabled (`loginctl enable-linger`).
- **Auto-restart on crash** (`Restart=on-failure`) + real logs via `journalctl`.

Use a **system** service instead only if it must start at boot with *no* user ever
logged in, or run under a shared service account — that needs sudo (see below).

Use **tmux** only for a quick, throwaway "keep it up for the afternoon" — it dies
on reboot and won't auto-restart. Documented last as a fallback.

## Prerequisites (once, in the repo on the target machine)

```bash
cd /path/to/APEXA-APS-Beamline-Assistant
git pull                 # get the latest
uv sync                  # create/refresh .venv (~1s)
./setup_user.sh          # writes .env (ANL_USERNAME, ARGO_MODEL, MIDAS_PATH)
test -f frontend/dist/index.html && echo "frontend OK"   # prebuilt, shipped
```

Smoke-test in the foreground before daemonizing:

```bash
.venv/bin/python3 web_server.py
# → open http://<machine>:8001 in a browser, run one query, Ctrl+C
```

> **Air-gapped / no-internet machine?** The RAG knowledge base needs its ~523 MB
> embedding model pre-staged, and off-machine data must be mounted/staged locally.
> See [`OFFLINE_DEPLOYMENT.md`](OFFLINE_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Install — systemd user service (recommended)

```bash
cd /path/to/APEXA-APS-Beamline-Assistant
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
sed "s#__APEXA_DIR__#$PWD#g" deploy/apexa-web.service \
    > ~/.config/systemd/user/apexa-web.service

systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now apexa-web      # start now + on login
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"               # keep running when logged out / after reboot

systemctl --user status apexa-web            # should read "active (running)"
```

Browse to `http://<machine-hostname>:8001`.

### Day-to-day operations

```bash
systemctl --user restart apexa-web           # after a config change
systemctl --user stop apexa-web
journalctl --user -u apexa-web -f            # live logs
journalctl --user -u apexa-web --since "1 hour ago"
```

### Updating to a new version

```bash
cd /path/to/APEXA-APS-Beamline-Assistant
git pull && uv sync
systemctl --user restart apexa-web
```

---

## System service variant (boot without a logged-in user; needs sudo)

```bash
sudo sed "s#__APEXA_DIR__#/path/to/APEXA-APS-Beamline-Assistant#g" \
    deploy/apexa-web.service | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/apexa-web.service
```

Then edit `/etc/systemd/system/apexa-web.service`:

- Uncomment `User=` / `Group=` (a dedicated account that owns the repo and `.venv` —
  **not** root).
- Change `WantedBy=default.target` → `WantedBy=multi-user.target`.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now apexa-web
sudo systemctl status apexa-web
sudo journalctl -u apexa-web -f
```

---

## Fallback — tmux (quick, non-persistent)

```bash
tmux new -s apexa
cd /path/to/APEXA-APS-Beamline-Assistant && .venv/bin/python3 web_server.py
# detach: Ctrl-b then d      reattach: tmux attach -t apexa
```

Dies on reboot, no auto-restart — use only for short-lived hosting.

---

## Decisions to settle with the beamline / supervisors

1. **Argo identity (the real policy call).** Argo Gateway authenticates with
   `ANL_USERNAME` from `.env`. A single shared service = **all traffic under one
   username** (a service account). That's fine for a shared console/demo, but if
   per-user attribution or quota matters you need a login layer that swaps the
   username per session. Raise this explicitly — it's policy, not code.

2. **Network exposure.** `0.0.0.0:8001` is reachable by anything that can route to
   the host. Confirm `:8001` is open on the beamline subnet / behind the APS
   firewall, or front it with a reverse proxy (nginx) for TLS + a friendly
   hostname. Change host/port via `APEXA_WEB_HOST` / `APEXA_WEB_PORT` in the unit.

3. **Security surface.** APEXA can run shell commands and drive motors via its MCP
   tools. Keep the service on the internal network only; if it's reachable more
   widely, add authentication (reverse-proxy basic auth at minimum) before going
   live. The destructive-command block and motor-confirmation prompts are a floor,
   not a substitute for network isolation.

## Health check

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8001/ >/dev/null && echo "APEXA web up"
```

Wire this into a monitoring check or a `systemd` timer if you want alerting.
