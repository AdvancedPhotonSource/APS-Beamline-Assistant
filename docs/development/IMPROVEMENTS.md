# Beamline Assistant Improvements

## Summary
Enhanced the Beamline Assistant with context memory and a cleaner user interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. Context Memory (argo_mcp_client.py)

**Problem:** AI forgot previous queries in the same session. When asked "Read the Parameters.txt file there" after listing a directory, it would ask for the path again.

**Solution:**
- Added `conversation_history` attribute to `ArgoMCPClient` class
- Modified `process_diffraction_query()` to maintain conversation context
- Stores last 10 exchanges (20 messages) to prevent token overflow
- AI now understands contextual references like "there", "it", "that file"

**Example:**
```
Beamline> List files in /Users/b324240/opt/MIDAS/FF_HEDM/Example
[Shows file listing]

Beamline> Read the Parameters.txt file there
[AI correctly infers path from previous query]
```

### 2. Clean Interface

**Problem:** Verbose debug output cluttered the interface with technical details.

**Solution:**

#### Client Side (argo_mcp_client.py)
- Commented out ~15 debug print statements
- Removed iteration counters
- Removed API request/response debugging
- Simplified tool execution messages
- Cleaner error formatting

#### Server Side (All MCP Servers)
- Added logging configuration to suppress INFO messages
- Only WARNING and ERROR messages now shown
- Applied to: midas_comprehensive_server.py, filesystem_server.py, command_executor_server.py

**Before:**
```
[10/09/25 15:28:40] INFO Processing request of type ListToolsRequest server.py:623
ðŸ”§ DEBUG: Argo API Request
  Model: gpt4o
  Tools provided: 16
  Tool names: ['midas_run_ff_hedm_simulation', 'midas_identify_crystalline_phases']...
```

**After:**
```
â†’ Filesystem Read File

[Clean AI response]
```

### 3. New Command: `clear`

**Purpose:** Reset conversation history when starting a new analysis task.

**Usage:**
```
Beamline> clear
âœ“ Conversation history cleared
```

### 4. Enhanced Help Documentation

Updated help command to include:
- New `clear` command
- Example of contextual queries
- Better command descriptions

## Files Modified

1. **argo_mcp_client.py**
   - Added conversation_history tracking
   - Modified process_diffraction_query() to use history
   - Added `clear` command
   - Cleaned up debug output
   - Updated help text

2. **midas_comprehensive_server.py**
   - Added logging configuration
   - Suppressed INFO-level messages

3. **filesystem_server.py**
   - Added logging configuration
   - Suppressed INFO-level messages

4. **command_executor_server.py**
   - Added logging configuration
   - Suppressed INFO-level messages

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**
   - Natural conversation flow
   - Cleaner, easier-to-read output
   - Professional interface matching Claude's style

2. **Improved Productivity**
   - No need to repeat context
   - Faster workflow navigation
   - Fewer keystrokes required

3. **Context Awareness**
   - AI remembers recent queries
   - Understands references to previous operations
   - Maintains analysis continuity

## Testing

Validated improvements with:
1. Syntax check passed for all modified files
2. Conversation history correctly maintains context
3. Clean output format confirmed
4. `clear` command resets history as expected

## Next Steps

Users can now:
1. Have natural conversations with contextual references
2. Use `clear` to reset conversation when needed
3. Enjoy a cleaner, more professional interface
4. Work more efficiently with remembered context
