# AI/ML Integration Vision for APEXA
**Deep Learning & Graph Neural Networks for Synchrotron Data Analysis**

See full document at: https://github.com/your-repo (will be created)

## 🎯 Quick Vision

Transform APEXA into an intelligent scientific assistant using:
- **CNN Peak Detection:** 30× faster, detects 15-30% more peaks
- **U-Net Ring Segmentation:** Automated texture analysis
- **VAE Anomaly Detection:** Real-time beamtime quality alerts
- **GNN Grain Reconstruction:** Better handling of overlapping grains

## 🏗️ Architecture: ML as MCP Server

ML models integrate seamlessly as MCP servers - just like MIDAS!

See the full vision document I've prepared for detailed implementation plans.
