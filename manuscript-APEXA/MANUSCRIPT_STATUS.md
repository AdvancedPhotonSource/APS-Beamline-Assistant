## Target Journal: Nature Communications

### Why Nature Comms?
1. **Broad interdisciplinary scope**: AI + materials science + synchrotron science
2. **Impact factor**: ~16.6 (high visibility)
3. **Open access**: Ensures broad community reach
4. **Rapid publication**: ~3-4 months from submission to publication
5. **Precedent**: Similar AI+science papers published

### Manuscript Alignment
- **Innovation**: First LLM-orchestrated autonomous beamline assistant
- **Impact**: 70-85% time reduction, democratization of access
- **Rigor**: Validated on real beamline, quantified performance
- **Generalizability**: 4 beamlines, modular architecture
- **Broader relevance**: Applicable to all synchrotrons, neutron sources

### Alternative: npj Computational Materials
If Nature Comms rejects or suggests lower-tier journal:
- More materials-focused audience
- Impact factor ~9
- Faster review (computational focus)
- Still high-quality, selective
