"""Network tiers — let APEXA run on a beamline machine with no public internet.

The failure this exists to prevent
----------------------------------
APEXA failed to launch on ``copland`` (a beamline analysis host with data access
and ANL-internal networking, but no route to the public internet). It hung at
startup trying to reach HuggingFace for the RAG embedding model.

The mechanism matters, because the obvious guard did not help: the knowledge-base
pre-warm in ``midas_comprehensive_server`` was already wrapped in ``try/except``,
but **a network hang is not an exception**. The HF HEAD request blocks on long
retries, the handler never fires, ``mcp.run()`` is never reached, and the client
waits forever for a server that never finishes starting. Fail-open only works if
the failure is *raised*; here it had to be *avoided*.

The model
---------
Three tiers, ordered by what the host can reach:

``data``
    Filesystem only. No LLM, so APEXA cannot really run — useful for offline
    validation, linting and tests.
``internal``  **← the beamline default**
    ANL-internal network: Argo Gateway, argo-proxy, ALCF Inference Service, SSH
    to analysis hosts. Everything that matters for data reduction works. The RAG
    embedder loads from a pre-staged cache and never touches the network.
``web``
    Also the public internet: HuggingFace downloads, Materials Project, DOI
    metadata.

``internal`` is the default **on purpose**. Defaulting to web-optimistic is what
caused the copland hang: a host that cannot reach the internet then discovers it
by blocking. Assuming the smaller network and letting a web-capable host opt up
fails safe on the machines that matter most.

Set ``APEXA_NETWORK=web|internal|data``; ``docs/setup_user.sh`` probes and writes
it. ``APEXA_OFFLINE=1`` remains supported and implies ``internal``.
